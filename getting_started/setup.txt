SUMMARY
1.  Install antiX Linux in VirtualBox.  You need the guest OS for working on Swift Linux.  Unless otherwise noted, ALL procedures described in this file are to be done in the guest OS.
2.  Set up guest additions to allow you to share files between the host and guest OS.
3.  Update the /etc/apt files.
4.  Create space for this project.
5.  Install Git.
6.  Take a snapshot in VirtualBox.  This is the point you may wish to return to later.
7.  Download this project.
8.  Copy your revised project from the guest OS to the host OS.
9.  Return to the snapshot you created and copy your project from the host OS to the guest OS.

SET UP GUEST ADDITIONS (allows you to share files between the host and guest OS)
1.  From the Guest OS, go to Devices -> Shared Folders and select the /home/(host username)/share directory on your host OS.  Select "Make Permanent".
2.  Go to Devices -> Guest Additions.
3.  In the Guest OS, enter "mkdir /home/(guest OS username)/host".
4.  As root in the Guest OS, enter the command "mount /media/cdrom"
5.  As root in the Guest OS, install the guest additions by going to /media/cdrom and running the VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run package (by entering "sh VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run").
6.  After the guest additions have been added, enter as root in the guest OS "mount -t vboxsf share /home/(guest OS username)/host".  
7.  Now the /home/(guest OS username)/host directory in the guest OS is mirrored by the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host OS.
8.  Each time you boot up the guest OS, you'll have to become root in the guest OS and enter ""mount -t vboxsf share /home/(guest OS username)/host" in order to resume sharing files between the guest and host OS.

UPDATE /etc/apt
1.  As root, go to the /etc/apt directory and update the files apt.conf, preferences, and sources.list with their corresponding contents in the files at https://github.com/swiftlinux/change_files/tree/master/config/apt .
2.  As root, enter "apt-get update".

CREATE SPACE FOR THIS PROJECT
1.  As root, enter the following commands:
mkdir /usr/local/bin/develop
cd /usr/local/bin
chown (username):users develop

INSTALL AND SET UP GIT
1.  Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/ 

SNAPSHOT
1.  When you have a directory for the project and Git installed, shut down the guest OS.
2.  When the virtual machine is off, take a snapshot.  This is the point you want to return to later in order to see the results of changes you make to the project WITHOUT having to set everything up again.

DOWNLOAD THIS PROJECT
1.  As your username, enter the following commands: 
cd /usr/local/bin/develop
git clone git://github.com/swiftlinux/change_files

COPYING THIS PROJECT TO THE HOST OS
1.  As your username, enter the following commands:
cd /usr/local/bin/develop
zip -r change_files.zip change_files
mount -t vboxsf share /home/(guest OS username)/host
su
cp change_files.zip /home/(guest OS username)/host
2.  In the host OS, copy the change_files.zip file from /home/(host OS username)/share to another directory.

COPYING THIS PROJECT FROM YOUR HOST OS TO GUEST OS
1.  There will be times when you need to see the impact of your changes to this project.  After you zip the change_files directory and copy it from the host OS to your guest OS, restore the VirtualBox snapshot you took just after installing and setting up Git.  Then boot up your guest OS.
2.  In the guest OS, enter as root "mount -t vboxsf share /home/(guest OS username)/host".
3.  In the host OS, copy the change_files.zip archive to /home/(host OS username)/share
4.  In the guest OS, enter the following commands as root:
cp /home/(guest OS username)/host/change_files.zip /usr/local/bin/develop
cd /usr/local/bin/develop
chown (guest OS username):users change_files.zip
exit
unzip change_files.zip
5.  Now your project is in the guest OS, and you are ready to resume work on it.
