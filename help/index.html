Because Swift Linux is based on antiX Linux, most of the tips in the antiX FAQ will also apply for Swift Linux.  However, there are some differences.

<H3>Basic Swift Linux Settings that Differ from antiX Linux</H3>
<UL>
<LI>In Swift Linux, the firewall program is enabled by default.  In antiX Linux, the firewall is installed but disabled by default.</LI>
<LI>Fluxbox, iDesk, Ted, Pidgin, Irssi, newsbeuter, and RipiT are NOT installed.</LI>
<LI>The Conky display is in the middle of the bottom of the desktop screen instead of the upper right corner.</LI>
<LI>By default, Swift Linux installs only required dependencies and not recommended ones.</LI>
<LI>Every edition of Swift Linux except Diet Swift Linux includes OpenOffice and extra forensic tools that are not pre-installed in antiX Linux</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Forensic Help</H3>
<A HREF="forensic/index.html">Forensic Tools</A>: Please note that only Regular Swift Linux and the special editions have all of the forensic tools.  Diet Swift Linux only has the forensic tools that antiX Linux already has (such as TestDisk and PhotoRec).
