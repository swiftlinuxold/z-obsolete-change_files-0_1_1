<h1>Forensic Swift Linux Help</h1>
Forensic Swift Linux is included with every edition of Swift Linux EXCEPT Diet Swift Linux.
<BR><BR>
Here is the list of included
forensic/recovery/rescue programs with brief summaries of what they do.
(Source: Synaptic) For a more detailed explanation of what these
programs do, open a terminal and type "man (program)". Most of these
programs can only be run from the command line.
<br><br>Please note that many of these programs can only be run as
root, so you'll have to enter the "su" command and provide the root
password before you can proceed.

<h3>autopsy</h3>
The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to the command line
digital forensic analysis tools in The Sleuth Kit. Together, The Sleuth Kit
and Autopsy provide many of the same features as commercial digital forensics
tools for the analysis of Windows and UNIX file systems (NTFS, FAT, FFS,
EXT2FS, and EXT3FS).

<h3>bkhive</h3>
This tool is designed to recover the syskey bootkey from a Windows NT/2K/XP
system hive. Then we can decrypt the SAM file with the syskey and dump
password hashes.
<br><br>
Syskey is a Windows feature that adds an additional encryption layer to the
password hashes stored in the SAM database.

<h3>chkrootkit</h3>
The chkrootkit security scanner searches the local system for signs
that it is infected with a 'rootkit'. Rootkits are set of programs
and hacks designed to take control of a target machine by using known
security flaws.
<br><br>
Types that chkrootkit can identify are listed on the project's home page.
<br><br>
Please note that where chkrootkit detects no intrusions, this does
not guarantee that the system is uncompromised. In addition to
running chkrootkit, more specific tests should always be performed.

<h3>chntpw</h3>
This little program provides a way to view information and
change user passwords in a Windows NT/2000 user database file.
Old passwords need not be known since they are overwritten.
In addition it also contains a simple registry editor
(same size data writes) and an hex-editor which enables you to
fiddle around with bits and bytes in the file as you wish.
<br><br>
If you want GNU/Linux boot disks for offline password recovery
you can add this utility to custom image disks or use those provided
at the tools homepage.

<h3>dares-qt</h3>
Dares scans a CD/DVD image or a CD/DVD for files. This also works when
the filesystem (ISO-9660 or UDF) on the disc is damaged and cannot be mounted
anymore.


<h3>dcfldd</h3>
Based on the dd program with the following additional features:<br>
 - Hashing on-the-fly, dcfldd can hash the input data as it is being
   transferred, helping to ensure data integrity.<br>
 - Status output, dcfldd can update the user of its progress in terms of the
   amount of data transferred and how much longer operation will take.<br>
 - Flexible disk wipes, dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly and with a
   known pattern if desired.<br>
 - Image/wipe Verify, dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a bit-for-bit
   match of the specified input file or pattern.<br>
 - Multiple outputs, dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks at the same
   time.<br>
 - Split output, dcfldd can split output to multiple files with more
   configurability than the split command.<br>
 - Piped output and logs, dcfldd can send all its log data and output to
   commands as well as files natively.<br>

<h3>ddrescue</h3>
dd_rescue is a tool to help you to save data from crashed partition.
It tries to read and if it fails, it will go on with the next sectors
where tools like dd will fail. If the copying process is interrupted
by the user it is possible to continue at any position later.
It can copy backwards.

<h3>dvdisaster</h3>
dvdisaster provides a margin of safety against data loss on CD and DVD media
caused by scratches or aging media. It creates error correction data which is
used to recover unreadable sectors if the disc becomes damaged at a later time.

<h3>e2fsck-static</h3>
This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
<br><br>
This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
in e2fsprogs, though.
<br><br>
You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.

<h3>e2undel</h3>
Interactive console tool to recover the data of deleted files on
an ext2 file system under Linux. It does not require knowledge
about how ext2 file systems works and should be usable by
most people.
<br><br>
This tools searches all inodes marked as deleted on a file system and
lists them as sorted by owner and time of deletion. Additionally,
it gives you the file size and tries to determine the file type in
the way file(1) does. If you did not just delete a whole bunch of
files with a 'rm -r *', this information should be helpful to find
out which of the deleted files you would like to recover.
<br><br>
E2undel will not work on ext3 (journaling) filesystems.

<h3>ext3grep</h3>
ext3grep is a simple tool intended to aid anyone who accidentally deletes a
file on an ext3 filesystem, only to find that they wanted it shortly
thereafter.

<h3>foremost</h3>
This is a console program to recover files based on their headers and footers
for forensics purposes.
<br><br>
Foremost can work on disk image files, such as those generated by dd,
Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers are
specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and choose which headers
you want to look for.

<h3>gddrescue</h3>
It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc)
to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors.
<br><br>
gddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to.
So, every time you run it on the same output file,
it tries to fill in the gaps.
<br><br>
The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic.
That is, you don't have to wait for an error, stop the program,
read the log, run it in reverse mode, etc.
If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued
very efficiently (only the needed blocks are read).
Also you can interrupt the rescue at any time and resume it later
at the same point.
<br><br>
Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged
copies of a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them,
one at a time, with the same output file, you will probably obtain
a complete and error-free file. This is so because the probability
of having damaged areas at the same places on different input files
is very low. Using the logfile, only the needed blocks are read from
the second and successive copies.
<br><br>
The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash you
can resume the rescue with little recopying. Also, the same logfile
can be used for multiple commands that copy different areas of the
file, and for multiple recovery attempts over different subsets.
<br><br>
gddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be
used to read from raw devices. For efficiency reasons, also aligns it
to the memory page size if page size is a multiple of sector size.

<h3>gpar2</h3>
A simple, easy to use graphical interface for verification and repair of
PAR v1.0 and PAR v2.0(PAR2) recovery sets. PAR1 support is currently minimal,
as it is deprecated this most likely will not change, so do not expect the
headers, progress, output, and status to update when performing actions
on these.

<h3>gpart</h3>
Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a
PC-type disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is
damaged, incorrect or deleted.
<br><br>
It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and
sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical.
It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them
(using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.).
<br><br>
The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly
believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk
device.
<br><br>
Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:<br>

 * BeOS filesystem type.<br>
 * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning<br>
   scheme used on Intel platforms.<br>
 * Linux second extended filesystem.<br>
 * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".<br>
 * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.<br>
 * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).<br>
 * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).<br>
 * The Minix operating system filesystem type.<br>
 * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.<br>
 * QNX 4.x filesystem.<br>
 * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X &gt; 11).<br>
 * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning<br>
   scheme on PC hard disks similar to the BSD disklabels.<br>
 * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux.<br>
<br><br>
Other types may be added relatively easily, as separately compiled modules.
<h3>guymager</h3>
The forensic imager contained in this package, guymager, was designed to
support different image file formats, to be most user-friendly and to run
really fast. It has a high speed multi-threaded engine using parallel
compression for best performance on multi-processor and hyper-threading
machines.

<h3>gzrt</h3>

gzrecover will attempt to skip over corrupted data in a gzip archive,
thereby allowing the remaining data to be recovered.
<br><br>
Please install cpio to facilitate recovery from damaged gzipped tarballs.

<h3>hfsplus</h3>
HFS+ is a modernized version of Apple Computers HFS Filesystem.
Nowadays, it is widely used with more recent versions of MacOS.
hfsplus consists of a library and a set of tools that allow access
to HFS+ volumes.
<br><br>
This package contains the tools themselves.

<h3>hfsutils</h3>
HFS is the native Macintosh filesystem format.
<br><br>
This package contains xhfs, a Tk-based X windows interface, and hfssh,
a Tcl-based shell.


<h3>jfsutils</h3>
Utilities for managing IBM's Journaled File System (JFS) under Linux.
<br><br>
IBM's journaled file system technology, currently used in IBM
enterprise servers, is designed for high-throughput server
environments, key to running intranet and other high-performance
e-business file servers.
<br><br>
The following utilities are available:<br>
fsck.jfs - initiate replay of the JFS transaction log, and check and repair a
JFS formatted device.
logdump - dump a JFS formatted device's journal log.<br>
logredo - "replay" a JFS formatted device's journal log.<br>
mkfs.jfs - create a JFS formatted partition.<br>
xchkdmp - dump the contents of a JFS fsck log file created with xchklog.<br>
xchklog - extract a log from the JFS fsck workspace into a file.<br>
xpeek - shell-type JFS file system editor.

<h3>john</h3>
john, mostly known as John the Ripper, is a tool designed to help systems
administrators to find weak (easy to guess or crack through brute force)
passwords, and even automatically mail users warning them about it, if it
is desired.
<br><br>
It can also be used with different cyphertext formats, including Unix's
DES and MD5, Kerberos AFS passwords, Windows' LM hashes, BSDI's extended DES,
and OpenBSD's Blowfish.

<h3>lde</h3>
This allows you to view some Linux fs's (a la Norton disk edit), hex block
and inode editing are now supported and you can use it to dump an erased file
to another partition with a little bit of work.  Supports ext2, minix,
and msdos.

<h3>lsscsi</h3>
Uses information in sysfs (Linux kernels 2.6.0 and later) to list all
scsi devices (or hosts) currently attached to the system. Options can
be used to control the amount and form of information provided for each
device.

<h3>magicrescue</h3> 
Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for
recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as the file data is
there, it will find it.

<h3>mtd-utils</h3>
Utilities for manipulating memory technology devices, such as flash
memory, Disk-On-Chip, or ROM.  Includes mkfs.jffs2, a tool to create
JFFS2 (journaling flash file system) filesystems.

<h3>myrescue</h3>
myrescue is a program to rescue the still-readable data from a damaged
harddisk. It is similar in purpose to dd_rescue, but it tries to quickly get
out of damaged areas to first handle the not yet damaged part of the disk and
return later.

<h3>ntfs-3g</h3>
The ntfs-3g driver is an open source, GPL licensed, third generation Linux
NTFS driver which was implemented by the Linux-NTFS project. It provides
full read-write access to NTFS, excluding access to encrypted files, writing
compressed files, changing file ownership, access right.
<br><br>
Technically it's based on and a major improvement to the third generation
Linux NTFS driver, ntfsmount. The improvements includes functionality,
quality and performance enhancements.
<br><br>
ntfs-3g is based on FUSE (userspace filesystem framework for Linux), thus
you will have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.
<br><br>
Fuse is available in any recent kernel. No need to prepare a kernel module
if you are already running Debian Etch kernel or newer.

<h3>ntfsprogs</h3>
The Linux-NTFS project (http://www.linux-ntfs.org/) aims to bring full
support for the NTFS filesystem to the Linux operating system.
<br><br>
This is a set of tools targeted for people interested in working
with the NTFS support in the Linux kernel and using it.  The
following utilities are included:
<br><br>
ntfsfix - Fix common filesystem errors and force Windows to check NTFS.
<br><br>
mkntfs - Format a partition with an NTFS filesystem, optionally bootable.
<br><br>
ntfsinfo - Show some information about an NTFS partition or one of the
files or directories within it.
<br><br>
ntfslabel - Show, or set, an NTFS partition's volume label.

(without mounting the partition).
<br><br>
ntfsls - List directory contents on an NTFS filesystem (without
mounting).
<br><br>
ntfscp - Overwrite files on an NTFS partition.
<br><br>
ntfsclone - Efficiently clone an NTFS filesystem or a part of it.
<br><br>
ntfsmount - Mount an NTFS partition from user-space using libntfs and FUSE.
<br><br>
ntfsdecrypt - Decrypt NTFS-encrypted files (NOT INCLUDED).
<br><br>
ntfscmp - Compare two NTFS volumes and tell the differences.

<h3>ophcrack</h3>
Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker based on a time-memory trade-off
using rainbow tables. This is a new variant of Hellman's original trade-off,
with better performance. It recovers 99.9% of alphanumeric passwords in
seconds.
<br><br>
It works for Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista.
<br><br>
A Gtk based UI is included.

<h3>ophcrack-cli</h3>
Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker based on a time-memory trade-off
using rainbow tables. This is a new variant of Hellman's original trade-off,
with better performance. It recovers 99.9% of alphanumeric passwords in
seconds.
<br><br>
It works for Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista.
<br><br>
This package contains ophcrack with command line interface only.

<h3>par2</h3>
A command line implementation of the PAR v2.0 specification.  This
specification is used for parity checking and repair of a file set.
If the files in the recovery set ever get damaged (e.g. when they are
transmitted or stored on a faulty disk) the client can read the damaged
input files, read the (possibly damaged) PAR files, and regenerate the
original input files. Of course, not all damages can be repaired, but
many can.
<h3>parchive</h3>
This utility applies the data-recovery capability concepts of RAID-like
systems to the posting and downloading of multi-part archives on USENET by
providing the ability to create and use redundant recovery records.  It
supports the 'Reed-Soloman Code' implementation that allows for recovery of
any 'X' volumes for 'X' parity volumes present.  It is popularly used on
USENET postings, but is not limited to this use.
<br><br>
The Debian parchive package supports "legacy" version 1.0 PAR files.
The Debian par2 package supports version 2.0 PAR files.

<h3>partimage</h3>
Partition Image is a partition imaging utility. It has support for the
following file systems:<br>
 * Ext2/3, the Linux standard<br>
 * ReiserFS, a journalised and powerful file system<br>
 * FAT16/32, DOS and Windows file systems<br>
 * HPFS, IBM OS/2 file system<br>
 * JFS, journalised file system, from IBM, used on AIX<br>
 * XFS, another journalised and efficient file system, from SGI, used on Irix<br>
 * UFS (beta), Unix file system<br>
 * HFS (beta), MacOS File system<br>
 * NTFS (experimental), Windows NT, 2000 and XP<br>
Only used blocks are copied and stored into an image file.
The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to save disk space,
and split into multiple files to be copied onto removable media (ZIP for
example), burned on a CD-R, etc.

This makes it possible to save a full Linux/Windows system with a single
operation. In case of a problem (virus, crash, error, etc.), you just have
to restore, and after several minutes, your entire system is restored
(boot, files, etc.), and fully working.

This is very useful when installing the same software on many machines: just
install one of them, create an image, and restore the image on all other
machines.
<h3>pasco</h3>
Pasco is a forensic tool that examines the content of cache files (index.dat)
produced by Microsofts Internet Explorer.
<br><br>
It parses the file and outputs a field separated that can be loaded in a
spreadsheet.

<h3>rdd</h3>
A forensic copy program developed at and used by
the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). Unlike most copy programs, rdd is
robust with respect to read errors, which is an important property in a
forensic operating environment.

<h3>readpst</h3>
ReadPST is an application that can take a Microsoft Outlook PST
(Personal Folders) file and convert it into mbox, kmail, its own
recursive format, or separate each email into its own file.

It can currently handle emails, folders and most contacts.

<h3>recover</h3>
Recover automates some steps as described in the ext2-undeletion
howto. This means it seeks all the deleted inodes on your hard drive
with debugfs. When all the inodes are indexed, recover asks you some
questions about the deleted file. These questions are:<br>
  * Hard disk device name<br>
  * Year of deletion<br>
  * Month of deletion<br>
  * Weekday of deletion<br>
  * First/Last possible day of month<br>
  * Min/Max possible file size<br>
  * Min/Max possible deletion hour<br>
  * Min/Max possible deletion minute<br>
  * User ID of the deleted file<br>
  * A text string the file included (can be ignored)
<br><br>
If recover found any fitting inodes, it asks to give a directory name
and dumps the inodes into the directory. Finally it asks you if you
want to filter the inodes again (in case you typed some wrong
answers).
<br><br>
Note that recover works only with ext2 filesystems - it does not support
ext3.


<h3>recoverdm</h3>
This program will help you recover disks with bad sectors. You can recover
files as well complete devices. In case if finds sectors which simply cannot be
recoverd, it writes an empty sector to the outputfile and continues.
<br><br>
If you're recovering a CD or a DVD and the program cannot read the sector in
"normal mode", then the program will try to read the sector in "RAW mode"
(without error-checking etc.). This toolkit also has a utility called
'mergebad' which merges multiple images into one.

<h3>recoverjpeg</h3>
Recoverjpeg tries to identify jpeg pictures from a filesystem image.
To achieve this goal, it scans the filesystem image and looks for a
jpeg structure at blocks starting at 512 bytes boundaries.

<h3>reiser4progs</h3>
The following utilities to manage Reiser4 filesystems are provided:
  - debugfs.reiser4<br>
  - fsck.reiser4<br>
  - measurefs.reiser4<br>
  - mkfs.reiser4
<h3>reiserfsprogs</h3>
This package contains utilities to create, check, resize, and debug
ReiserFS filesystems.

<h3>rifiuti</h3>
Rifiuti is a tool to examine the INFO2 files found in the MS Windows
recycle bins.

The INFO2 file gives meta informations about the files found in the
recycle bin.

<h3>rifiuti2</h3>
Rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, a tool for analyzing Windows Recycle Bin
INFO2 file.
<br><br>
Analysis of Windows Recycle Bin is usually carried out during Windows computer
forensics. Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original path and size of
deleted files and whether the deleted files have been moved out from the
recycle bin since they are trashed. It supports the INFO2 file format found in
Windows up to Window XP as well as the new file format found in Vista.

<h3>safecopy</h3> 
Safecopy is a data recovery tool which tries to extract as much data as
possible from a seekable, but problematic (i.e. damaged sectors) source - like
floppy drives, harddisk partitions, CDs, ..., where other tools like dd would
fail due to I/O errors.

<h3>scalpel</h3>
A fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer definitions
and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw device files.
Scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve files from FATx, NTFS, ext2/3,
or raw partitions. It is useful for both digital forensics investigation and
file recovery.

<h3>sleuthkit</h3>
The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection of UNIX-based
command line file system and media management forensic analysis tools.
The file system tools allow you to examine file systems of a suspect
computer in a non-intrusive fashion. Because the tools do not rely on
the operating system to process the file systems, deleted and hidden
content is shown.
<br><br>
The media management tools allow you to examine the layout of disks and
other media. The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions
(disk labels), Mac partitions, and Sun slices (Volume Table of
Contents). With these tools, you can identify where partitions are
located and extract them so that they can be analyzed with file system
analysis tools.
<br><br>
When performing a complete analysis of a system, we all know that
command line tools can become tedious. The Autopsy Forensic Browser is
a graphical interface to the tools in The Sleuth Kit, which allows you
to more easily conduct an investigation. Autopsy provides case
management, image integrity, keyword searching, and other automated
operations.

<h3>scrounge-ntfs</h3>
Utility that can rescue data from corrupted NTFS partitions writes the files
retrieved to another working file system.

<h3>squashfstools</h3>
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib
compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the
system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
<br><br>
Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use
(i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block
device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.

<h3>sshfs</h3>
sshfs is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the
client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
server with ssh.

<h3>tct </h3>
The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) is a collection of programs by Dan Farmer and
Wietse Venema for a post-mortem analysis of a UNIX system after a break-in.
TCT enables you to collect date regarding deleted files, modification times
of files and more.
<br><br>
Install this BEFORE you need to use it, so you don't risk destroying
essential forensic data before you begin.
<br><br>
Tools contained within this package: grave-robber, lazarus,
inode-cat (ex icat), ils, unrm and pcat.

<h3>testdisk</h3>
TestDisk checks the partition and boot sectors of your disks.
 It is very useful in recovering lost partitions.

<h3>unhide </h3>

Unhide is a forensic tool to find processes and TCP/UDP ports hidden by
rootkits, Linux kernel modules or by other techniques.  It includes two
utilities: unhide and unhide-tcp.
<br><br>
unhide detects hidden processes using three techniques:<br>
 - comparing the output of /proc and /bin/ps<br>
 - comparing the information gathered from /bin/ps with the one gathered
   from system calls (syscall scanning)<br>
 - full scan of the process ID space (PIDs bruteforcing)
<br><br>
unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but are not listed in
/bin/netstat through brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports available.
<br><br>
This package can be used by rkhunter in its daily scans.
<h3>vdmfec</h3>
VDMFEC implements Block ECC using a Forward Error Correction
(FEC) code based on Vandermonde (VDM) matrices in GF(2^8) due
to Luigi Rizzo. Given the FEC parameters K and N, with N
greater than K, N blocks are written for every K input blocks
in such a way that any K blocks are sufficient to reconstruct
the data. That is, up to N - K blocks out of every group of N
blocks may be lost without loss of data. Its primary
application is intended to be in recovering data from
unreliable media such as diskettes.
<h3>vinetto</h3>
A tool intended for forensics examinations. It is a console program to extract
thumbnail images and their metadata from those thumbs.db files generated under
Windows. Used in forensic environments
